CODE EXPLANATION: NLP Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Readability Analysis

Libraries Used:

•	pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data.

•	nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and sentiment analysis.

•	urllib: Used for opening URLs and fetching their contents.

•	bs4 (BeautifulSoup): Used for parsing HTML and XML documents, aiding in web scraping.

•	textblob: Used for processing textual data and calculating sentiment polarity and subjectivity.

•	cmudict: Part of NLTK, used for syllable counting.


Functions:

•	process_text(text): Tokenizes the input text, removes punctuation, stopwords, and performs stemming on the remaining words.

•	calculate_sentiment_scores(processed_text): Calculates positive and negative sentiment scores based on the presence of words from positive and negative word lists.

•	calculate_polarity_subjectivity(processed_text): Utilizes TextBlob to calculate polarity (sentiment) and subjectivity of the processed text.

•	calculate_readability_scores(processed_text): Calculates readability attributes including average sentence length, percentage of complex words, and Fog Index.

•	calculate_additional_attributes(processed_text): Calculates additional attributes including average words per sentence, word count, average syllables per word, personal pronouns count, and average word length.

•	process_url(url): Opens a URL, fetches its content, processes the text, and calculates sentiment, textblob scores, readability, and additional attributes.


Logic:

•	Load the DataFrame containing 'URL_ID' and 'URL'.

•	Initialize necessary NLTK objects like stop words list, stemmer, and load positive and negative words from Master Dictionary files.

•	For each URL in the DataFrame, the following steps are performed:

•	Fetch the HTML content of the URL and extract the text using BeautifulSoup.

•	Process the text using the process_text function.

•	Calculate sentiment scores using both positive/negative word lists and TextBlob.

•	Calculate readability attributes including average sentence length, percentage of complex words, and Fog Index.

•	Calculate additional attributes like average words per sentence, word count, average syllables per word, personal pronouns count, and average word length.

•	Store the calculated scores and attributes in the DataFrame.

•	The DataFrame is printed to display all the scores and attributes.



Terms and Concepts:

•	Tokenization: The process of splitting text into individual words or tokens.

•	Stopwords: Common words like "and", "the", "is" that are often removed during text processing to focus on meaningful content.

•	Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form. For instance, "running" becomes "run".

•	Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing text to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in it.

•	TextBlob: A Python library that simplifies text processing tasks like part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and translation.

•	Readability Analysis: Assessing how easy it is to read a piece of text. The Fog Index estimates the readability of text based on sentence length and the percentage of complex words.

•	Complex Words: Words with multiple syllables or that are not commonly found in everyday language.

•	Average Sentence Length: The average number of words in a sentence.

•	Fog Index: A readability test that estimates the years of formal education required to understand a text.

•	Syllable Counting: Determining the number of syllables in a word, used for readability analysis.

•	Personal Pronouns: Pronouns that refer to individuals: "I", "you", "he", "she", "it", etc.

•	Average Word Length: Calculating the average number of characters in words in a given text.
